# Chat Mirror Application

## Overview
The **Chat Mirror Application** is a simple chat interface where the user can send and receive messages. The app simulates a basic chat with a customer service agent. Whenever the user sends a message, the app responds by echoing the same message. This project demonstrates a basic chat interface, message animations, and SwiftData-based message persistence for the current session.

## Features
- **Send Message**: Users can type and send simple text messages.
- **Receive Message**: The app echoes back the user's message as a simulated response.
- **Message Animation**: Messages fade in as they appear in the chat.
- **Session-Based Persistence**: Messages are stored temporarily during the session using SwiftData (without long-term persistence).
- **Clear History**: A "Clear" button is available to delete the message history.
- **Scroll to Input View**: The chat scrolls automatically when new messages are added or when the keyboard appears.
